# GitHub File Diff Ignore Whitespace Toggle

Inject the javascript found in `insert.js` onto every **GitHub** page.

## Working pages
* Pull Request File Diff
* Pull Request Commit File Diff

## Current Issues
* May require page refresh to be injected (as GitHub does not do full page reloads on tab clicks)
* Ignoring whitespace on diffs also hides any review comments made on lines in files

## ToDo
* Still inject on non full page reloads
* Make into Chrome extension
